\# Problem Statement



\*\*Project:\*\* AI-Based Meeting Minutes Automation System  

\*\*Course:\*\* AI252TA - Machine Learning Operations (MLOps)



\*\*Short description:\*\* Build an end-to-end MLOps platform that converts multi-speaker meeting audio into structured, actionable meeting minutes. The system will transcribe audio, discover topics, extract action items (TASK, ASSIGNEE, DEADLINE), and produce an executive summary and structured report.



\*\*Input:\*\* Multi-speaker meeting audio files (.wav) + existing AMI XML transcripts for training.  

\*\*Output:\*\* For each meeting: (1) accurate transcript with speaker labels, (2) discovered topics, (3) extracted action items with assignees \& deadlines, (4) concise executive summary, (5) downloadable structured report (JSON + human-readable).



\*\*Key features:\*\*

\- Real-time captioning (simulated for demos by streaming or chunked transcripts)

\- Post-call full pipeline processing for final report

\- MLOps practices: data versioning, experiment tracking, pipeline orchestration, CI/CD, model registry, monitoring



\*\*Primary Audience:\*\* knowledge workers, teachers, students, meeting admins.



\*\*Why it matters:\*\* reduces manual effort, increases accessibility, improves knowledge retention.
